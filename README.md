# Stimulus_specific_adaptation
simulate stimulus specific adaptation of complex stimuli via dynamic synapses

The neural network model was written using simulation package Brian2. 
The original scripts included the cochlear model (Zilany MS et al., 2014) that takes sound waveform as input and output spike trains in the auditory nerve. That part is unfornately missing.
